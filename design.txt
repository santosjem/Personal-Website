So I want this website to tell a story so I think that the final design
that I'm going to go with is a single page website. I want the website to
slowly tell my story as the users scroll down the page. Maybe
have a separate page for my photography portfolio but maybe not since I could
just showcase those in the single page.
I expect the design for this website to change often.
